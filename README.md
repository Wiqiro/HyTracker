# Hytracker

HyTracker is an app designed to track your stats on the Hypixel Minecraft server. For now, session tracking hasn't been implemented. However, it is possible to get the stats of any player in Bedwars, Skywars, and Duels.

### To get started:
- Get a Hypixel Development Key on https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard (you will need to create a Hypixel account and connect it with your Minecraft account)
- Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/Wiqiro/HyTracker`
- Go to the project's folder `cd Hytracker`
- Plug your phone and run the project `flutter run`

Note: As this project is in its early stages of development, you may encounter some bugs.
