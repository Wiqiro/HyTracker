# Hytracker

HyTracker is an app designed to track your stats on the Hypixel Minecraft server. For now, session tracking hasn't been implemented. However, it is possible to get the stats of any player in Bedwars, Skywars, and Duels.

To get started, clone this repo and put your developpement API key in lib/utils.constants.dart. You will then be able to run the app on your phone.

Note: This project is still in early developpement, therefore you will probably encounter a lot of bugs.
